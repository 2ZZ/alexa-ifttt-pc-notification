# **Alexa-IFTTT-PC-Notification**

This repository demonstrates the flow of sending notifications from Alexa to a PC application using IFTTT, a backend application, and MQTT.

## **Components:**

1. **Alexa**: The voice-controlled virtual assistant.
2. **IFTTT**: A platform that connects different apps and devices using simple conditional statements.
3. **Backend App**: A custom application that acts as an intermediary between IFTTT and the PC app.
4. **MQTT**: A lightweight messaging protocol for IoT devices.
5. **PC App**: The application running on a PC that receives the notifications.

## **Integration Steps:**

1. Create an account on IFTTT: Visit [IFTTT Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) to sign up and access the Webhooks service.
2. Configure Alexa and IFTTT: Set up the necessary triggers and actions in IFTTT to connect Alexa with the Webhooks service.
3. Develop the Backend App: Create a custom backend application that receives Webhooks requests from IFTTT and converts them into MQTT messages.
4. MQTT Integration: Connect the Backend App with the MQTT broker to publish messages.
5. PC App Integration: Develop the PC application that subscribes to the MQTT broker and receives the notifications sent from Alexa.

## **Usage:**

Follow the steps outlined above to set up the integration between Alexa, IFTTT, the Backend App, MQTT, and the PC App. Once everything is properly configured and connected, you can use Alexa to trigger actions that will result in notifications being sent to the PC application.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation provided within each component's respective repository.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and you may need to refer to additional documentation and code samples to implement the integration successfully.
